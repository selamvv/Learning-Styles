Carol Dweck argues that mindsets is the biggest setback for students trying to complete their education. There is the fixed mindset, which is when one attempt to always know what they are doing 
and run away from anything that they don’t know how to do. These students also believe that trying is a negative thing, they don’t believe people work to get intelligent, they think you are born 
smart or you are not and lastly they understand that mistakes are a part of learning. 

Both approaches believe that learning is a growing process, Muller explains that is he had just given the question and answer, people will not feel engaged and won’t retain the information.

Both of the experts also encourage people to embrace what they don’t know, while Muller was going around stumping people on the street and Dweck 
emphasized the importance of embracing challenges and looking at both effort and mistakes as learning techniques. 

Both experts think that learning needs to be something that the student wants to do, which means they are okay with not being right all the time.

Muller focused on making people aware of what they don’t know in order to make them curious about what the correct answer is.
